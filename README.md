## about

This is a SPA that lets user keep a record of all their gear.

I took multiple approaches for this project.

This is because I had to balance all the tools at my disposal and the fact that
I only had less that a week to meet all the requirements.

Therefore, I first deployed my app without a framework and used JQuery and AJAX
instead. In 2 days I had met the requirements and all user stories were complete
with all facets being functional. Since I had done this before I knew it would
be quick with no major hurdles.

With 4 days left and no worries on my shoulders, I took on the challenge of
implementing Ember as the frontend framework.

## Dependencies

npm install

## User Stories

Users are intende to be rock climbers. As a climber myself I know how annoying
it is to always count how much of this or that gear you have, so this appear
will get rid of this nuance.

As a user I want to:
- Sign up
- Sign in
- Change password
- Sign out
- view all my gear
- Add gear
- Update my gear
- Delete my gear
